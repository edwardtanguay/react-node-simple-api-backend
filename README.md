# React frontend with simple Node/Express backend with one route

This is the minimal starting point for a basic React-frontend with Node/Express-backend. Frontend is Vite React with Sass, React Router, useContext and a CLI command to create pages (`npm run cp`), while the backend is a minimal Node/Express but with a simple MVC structure with server.ts which calls a function in model.ts. This is a good project if you want to build a multi-page application that has a backend that serves it data.
